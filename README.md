# SEBNet

## Overview
Semantic Boundary-Conditioned Network (SEBNet) is a family of real-time CNNs developed for the semantic segmentation task. SEBNet leverages principles from the Semantic Boundary Detection (SBD) task to improve the segmentation quality of a real-time architecture based on PIDNet [[1]](#1). SEBNet also leverages the OTFGT module from [[2]](#2) and pyEdgeEval from [[3]](#3) for SBD peformance improvements and evaluation, respectively.

## Description
The development of SEBNet was sequential and comprehensive. There are two stages.

### Stage 1 - Pre-training
To begin, a vanilla CNN backbone is adapted from the integral (I) branch of PIDNet. Two variations of the backbone are pre-trained on the ImageNet Dataset: 
1. The first backbone is trained traditionally, it is the vanilla backbone.
2. The second backbone is trained with an attached KoLeo Regularizer for better feature discrimination between similar features.

### Stage 2 - Finetuning
Next, a decoder is attached for the downstream semantic segmentation task. A baseline is established prior to 9 ablation studies that examine the effects of different heads. These heads either directly contribute to the dense prediction yielded by SEBNet, or they condition the backbone.
1.  **Ablation 01** - A baseline is established by attaching a pyramid pooling module (DAPPM or PAPPM) and a vanilla segmentation head.
2.  **Ablation 02** - Baseline + P Head (from PIDNet's P Branch)
3.  **Ablation 03** - Baseline + D Head (from PIDNet's D Branch)
4.  **Ablation 04** - Baseline + CASENet SBD Head
5.  **Ablation 05** - Baseline + DFF SBD Head
6.  **Ablation 06** - Baseline + BEM SBD Head
7.  **Ablation 07** - Baseline + P Head + D Head (PIDNet)
8.  **Ablation 08** - Baseline + P Head + SBD Head
9.  **Ablation 09** - Baseline + D Head + SBD Head
10. **Ablation 10** - Baseline + P Head + D Head + SBD Head (PIDNet + SBD)

## Results
Results are pending. The target date for results is June 31st, 2025. Model weights for the best performing networks will be uploaded following experimentation.
